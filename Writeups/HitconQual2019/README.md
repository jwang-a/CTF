# HITCON QUAL 2019

I played hitcon quals this year with Flagiarism  
We once reached 3rd place at the end of day1, but dropped to 30th at the end of day2 QQ  

Personally solved 5 problems (4 pwn, 1 misc) during the game, with 2 of them somewhat very different from intended solutions  

Will gradually update the writeups here
