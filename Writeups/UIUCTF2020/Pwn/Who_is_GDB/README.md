## Problem Recap

This challenge presents a gdb client connecting to attackers. So me must impersonate a gdbserver and perform flag file read somehow.

## Solution

Idk why this is even counted as pwn, just read document and figure out appropriate responses that trigger file read.
See solve script for commented step by step walkthrough.
