###Good old shellshock
###Shellshock CVE-2014-6271 is a vulnerability found in bash(1.0.3â€“2.05b)
###It started in bash evaluating environment variables as functions upon startup
###The problem is that the evaluation does not stop at the end of function declarement
###Thus, if a function looked like '() { :;}; echo shocked'
###The parser will continue evaluating after the useless func and echo shocked
###This results in command injection if attackers can control the environment variables upon starting bash

###env executes command with given environment variables
env exp='() { :;}; /bin/cat flag' ./shellshock
