###This problem requires input_key = key1()+key2()+key3()
###r0 is the return value in arm
###pc is instruction pointer(always point to next next instruction)
###lr is return addr
###bx is unconditional branch
###There are two modes(ARM(32bit) and THUMB(16bit)) in arm, the corresponding instruction length is 4bytes/2bytes
###Only bx is allowed to change between mode
###Upon bx execution, the last bit of target register is used as mode switch
###(0-> ARM, 1 -> THUMB), then cleared before jump

key1() = 0x8ce4
key2() = 0x8d0c
key3() = 0x8d80
