Though there are tools plugins that help enhance lldb user experience
None of them actually seem as convenient as gdb-peda(more specifically, the telescope util which dereference stack values smartly)
Thus, I'll try to write a similar tool that supports those display and some basic commands for lldb
Here is just a simple reminder in case I forget about this
