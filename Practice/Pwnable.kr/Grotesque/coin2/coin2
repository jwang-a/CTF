You have given some gold coins in your hand.
however, there is one counterfeit coin among them
counterfeit coin looks exactly same as real coin
luckily, its weight is different from real one
real coin weighs 10, counterfeit coin weighes 9
help me to find the counterfeit coin with a scale.
if you find 100 counterfeit coins, you will get reward :)
FYI, you have 60 seconds.

- How to play - 
1. you get a number of coins (N) and number of chances (C) to use scale
2. then you specify C set of index numbers of coins to be weighed
3. you get the weight information of each C set
4. you give the answer

- Example -
[Server] N=4 C=2 	# find counterfeit among 4 coins with 2 trial
[Client] 0 1-1 2	# weigh two set of coins (first and second), (second and third)
[Server] 20-20		# scale result : 20 for first set, 20 for second set
[Client] 3 		# counterfeit coin is fourth!
[Server] Correct!

- Note - 
dash(-) is used as a seperator for each set
