    Beyond the gates of elves' fortress
    A corridor unwinds before your eyes
    ...
    Walk and walk and walk, the path stretches into the heavy darkness
    Checking the pocketwatch, you realize you've been walking for a straight 3 hours
    The deafening silence is also getting your nerves
    Even the sound of your footsteps seem to be absorbed into the looming stone walls
    ...
    Another 2 hours of walking
    Weary and tired, you decide to take a short rest
    Sitting down against the wall
    You close your eyes
    ...
    A rustling sound woke you up
    The first thing you noticed is your torch was out
    This made you panic a little
    When was the last time you made such a grave mistake?
    Suddenly, a soft silver light lit up the place
    Not far in front of you stood a horse like beast
    Its mane whiter than snow
    A single horn spiraled from the center of its forehead
    A unicorn, you gasped

    Slowly, the unicorn points it horn at you
    From the tip of its horn, a bright burst of flame erupted
    Launching a ball of flame toward you
    ...
    -------------------------------------------------------
    Panting
    You finally put down the unicorn
    But not without any loss
    All your gears and weapons are reduced to ashes
    And your left arm is severly wounded in the battle

    You plop down against the walls, and reached for a cigar
    Just to realize that your lighter was destroyed along with other stuff

    Suddenly, the assumedly dead body trembled
    To your horror, the corspe of the unicorn rises again
    -------------------------------------------------------
    You never thought you had talent for magic and spells
    But now is not the time to rejoice over this
    As the corpse burns
    The flames slowly manifests into the shape of the unicorn
    Its eyes now burning with rage
