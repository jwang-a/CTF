# ASTRAL

Custom Applet Processor Fullchain

Emulated Processor VM bytecode execution -> Emulated Processor -> Userspace program -> Kernel -> Hypervisor

|             | Solves | Estimated Solves |
| ----------- | ------ | ---------------- |
| Nebula      | 12/333 | 50/500           |
| Protostar   | 2/333  | 25/500           |
| Redgiant    | 0/333  | 10/500           |
| Supernova   | 0/333  | 15/500           |
| Neutron     | 0/333  | 75/500           |
| StarryNight | 0/333  | 5/500            |

## Note

Nebula / Protostar / Redgiant / Supernova / Neutron are the five stages of StarryNight.
Patches are applied to directly allow players to run their bytecode / shellcode in supposedly compromised components. Apply patches to files in StarryNight to re-create environment.
